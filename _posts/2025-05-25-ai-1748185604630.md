This is a Liquid template tag.  It's designed to access and display a JSON object's `prompt` property.  The `$json` variable presumably holds the JSON data.

To make this work, you need:

1. **A JSON object:**  This object needs to exist and be accessible to the Liquid template engine as the `$json` variable.  For example:

   ```json
   {
     "prompt": "What is the meaning of life?",
     "otherData": "some other stuff"
   }
   ```

2. **A Liquid template engine:**  This engine will process the template and substitute the value of `$json.prompt` into the output.  Many systems use Liquid, including Shopify, Jekyll, and others.

3. **Context:** The `$json` variable needs to be passed to the template engine within the correct context.  The exact method depends on the system you're using.


**Example in a hypothetical system:**

Let's say you're using a system where you can pass data to a template like this:

```python
import liquid

template = liquid.Template("{{ $json.prompt }}")
json_data = {"prompt": "What is the meaning of life?", "otherData": "some other stuff"}
output = template.render(json_data)
print(output)  # Output: What is the meaning of life?
```

This Python code uses the `liquid` library to render the template.  The `json_data` dictionary is passed as context, making `$json` accessible within the template.


**Without knowing the specific system you're using, this is the most general explanation possible.**  To get a more specific answer, please provide details about your environment (e.g., programming language, templating engine, how you're passing data to the template).

This is a Liquid template tag.  It's accessing a JSON object named `$json` and extracting the value associated with the key "prompt".  It's likely used in a templating engine like Jekyll or Shopify.

To understand what it *does*, we need to know the contents of the `$json` variable.  For example:

If `$json` contains:

```json
{
  "prompt": "What is the meaning of life?",
  "answer": "42"
}
```

Then the output of `{{ $json.prompt }}` would be:

```
What is the meaning of life?
```

Without knowing the content of `$json`, we can only say that the tag will output the value of the "prompt" key within the `$json` JSON object.  If the "prompt" key doesn't exist, the output will depend on the specific templating engine's error handling â€“ it might output nothing, an error message, or some default value.

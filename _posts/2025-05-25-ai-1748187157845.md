This is a Liquid template syntax.  It's designed to access a JSON object named `json` and extract the value of the `prompt` key within that object.

To make this work, you need a Liquid processor and a JSON object.  Here's how you might use it:

**Example using Python and the `liquid` library:**

```python
import json
from liquid import Environment

# Sample JSON data
json_data = {"prompt": "This is my prompt text."}

# Create a Liquid environment
env = Environment()

# Render the template
template = env.from_string("{{ $json.prompt }}")
result = template.render(json={"prompt": json_data['prompt']})

# Print the result
print(result)  # Output: This is my prompt text.
```

**Explanation:**

* **`import json` and `from liquid import Environment`:** Imports necessary libraries. You'll need to install the `liquid` library (`pip install liquid`).
* **`json_data`:** This dictionary holds the JSON data.  The key `prompt` contains the text you want to display.
* **`env = Environment()`:** Creates a Liquid environment.
* **`template = env.from_string(...)`:**  Parses the Liquid template string.
* **`result = template.render(...)`:** Renders the template, passing the `json_data` as a context variable named `json`.
* **`print(result)`:** Prints the rendered output, which will be the value of `json.prompt`.

**Other Implementations:**

You can adapt this to other languages and templating engines that support Liquid or similar syntax.  The core principle remains the same:  you need to provide a JSON object and a mechanism to parse the Liquid template and access the JSON data within it.  For example, you could use a JavaScript Liquid library in a Node.js application or a Ruby implementation in a Rails project.  The key is that the `$json` variable needs to be defined in the context passed to the Liquid renderer.

This is a Liquid template that accesses a JSON object named `$json` and extracts the value associated with the key "prompt".  It simply outputs the value of `$json.prompt`.

To use this, you'd need a JSON object like this:

```json
{
  "prompt": "This is my prompt text."
}
```

Then, when the Liquid template is rendered with this JSON data, it would output:

```
This is my prompt text.
```

If the `$json` object doesn't contain a "prompt" key, or if `$json` itself is missing, the output will depend on how the Liquid engine handles missing keys.  It might output nothing, an error, or some default value, depending on the specific implementation.  It's good practice to handle potential missing keys using Liquid's conditional logic (e.g., `{% if json.prompt %}{{ json.prompt }}{% endif %}`) to avoid unexpected behavior.

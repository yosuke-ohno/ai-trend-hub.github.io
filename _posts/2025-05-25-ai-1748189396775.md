This is a Liquid template tag.  It's designed to extract the `prompt` key from a JSON object stored in a variable named `json`.

Let's break it down:

* **`{{ ... }}`**: This is the standard Liquid syntax for outputting a value.  Anything inside these braces will be rendered as output.

* **`$json`**: This refers to a variable named `json`.  It's assumed this variable holds a JSON object (e.g.,  `{"prompt": "What is the meaning of life?", "otherKey": "someValue"}`).

* **`.prompt`**: This accesses the value associated with the key "prompt" within the `json` object.

**How it works:**

The template engine will:

1. Look for a variable called `json`.
2. Access the `prompt` property of that variable.
3. Output the value of the `prompt` property.

**Example:**

If `$json` contains:

```json
{
  "prompt": "What is the capital of France?",
  "context": "This is a geography question."
}
```

Then the output of `{{ $json.prompt }}` would be:

```
What is the capital of France?
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:**  If the `json` variable doesn't exist or doesn't contain a `prompt` key, the output will likely be empty or result in an error, depending on the Liquid implementation.  Robust templates would include error handling to gracefully manage such cases.

* **JSON Parsing:**  The `json` variable needs to be properly parsed as a JSON object before this template can work.  This parsing would typically happen before the template is rendered, likely in the application's code (e.g., using a JSON library in Python, JavaScript, Ruby, etc.).

* **Context:** This code snippet is just a part of a larger Liquid template.  The complete template would likely include other elements surrounding this expression.

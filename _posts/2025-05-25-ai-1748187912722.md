This is a Jinja template expression.  It's designed to extract the `prompt` field from a JSON object stored in a variable named `json`.

Let's break it down:

* `{{ ... }}`: This is the Jinja templating syntax for outputting a variable's value or the result of an expression.
* `$json`: This likely refers to a variable (in the context of a larger templating engine like Jinja2) that holds a JSON object.  The `$` might be a prefix used by a specific templating system or framework.  It's not standard Jinja syntax, but many frameworks extend Jinja.
* `.prompt`: This accesses the member named "prompt" within the `$json` object.  It assumes `$json` is a dictionary-like structure (like a Python dictionary or a JavaScript object) where you can access keys using the dot notation.

**Example:**

If `$json` contains the following JSON:

```json
{
  "prompt": "What is the meaning of life?",
  "other_field": "some value"
}
```

Then the expression `{{ $json.prompt }}` would output:

```
What is the meaning of life?
```

**Important Note:**  The `$` prefix before `json` is not standard Jinja.  The actual syntax depends on the specific templating engine or framework you're using.  If you're using a framework like Django, Flask (with Jinja), or another, consult its documentation to understand how it handles variables and JSON access.  The `$` might be part of a custom filter or extension.

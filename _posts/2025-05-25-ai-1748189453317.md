This is a Jinja template expression.  It's designed to extract the value of the `prompt` key from a JSON object stored in a variable named `json`.

Let's break it down:

* `{{ ... }}`: This is the Jinja templating syntax for variable substitution.  It tells the Jinja engine to evaluate the expression inside and replace it with the result.

* `$json`: This likely refers to a variable named `json` containing a JSON object (e.g., a Python dictionary or a JavaScript object).  The `$` might be a specific convention of the templating engine you're using (some engines use `$` to access variables).  It's not standard Jinja, though.  Standard Jinja would likely use just `json`.

* `.prompt`: This is attribute access (or dot notation).  It accesses the value associated with the key "prompt" within the `json` object.

**Example:**

If `json` contains:

```json
{
  "prompt": "What is the meaning of life?",
  "other_key": "some other value"
}
```

Then the expression `{{ $json.prompt }}` (or `{{ json.prompt }}` in standard Jinja) would render as:

```
What is the meaning of life?
```

**Important Note:**  The use of `$` before `json` is not standard Jinja syntax.  You need to check the documentation for your specific templating engine to confirm the correct syntax for accessing variables.  If it's a modified or custom Jinja environment, the `$` might be part of its variable naming scheme.  If it's not intended to be part of the variable name, then the expression should be changed to `{{ json.prompt }}`.

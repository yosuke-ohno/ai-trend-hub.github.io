This is a Jinja template expression.  It's designed to extract the `prompt` key from a JSON object stored in a variable named `json`.

Let's break it down:

* `{{ ... }}`: This is the Jinja templating syntax for outputting a variable or the result of an expression.
* `$json`: This likely refers to a variable (in the context of a larger application or system) that holds a JSON object.  The `$` might indicate a specific naming convention within that system.
* `.prompt`: This uses dot notation to access the value associated with the key "prompt" within the `$json` object.

**Example:**

If `$json` contained the following JSON data:

```json
{
  "prompt": "What is the capital of France?",
  "other_data": "some other information"
}
```

Then the expression `{{ $json.prompt }}` would output:

```
What is the capital of France?
```

**Important Note:**  This will only work correctly if:

1. The variable `$json` is defined and accessible within the Jinja templating environment.
2. The `$json` variable actually contains a JSON object with a "prompt" key.  If the key is missing or the value is null, the output will be empty or an error might occur depending on the Jinja configuration.

To use this, you would need a Jinja templating engine and provide it with the appropriate context (the `$json` variable).  The exact method for doing so depends on the specific templating library and framework you are using (e.g., Flask, Django, etc.).
